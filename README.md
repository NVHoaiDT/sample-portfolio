## About this repo

A demo portfolio site created just for the Web Programming subject, serving as an exam submission.

## Warning

This project originally used some legacy React patterns that have changed significantly in recent versions. I chose this template because it was easy to use and quick to deploy (Have to admit, I was pretty lazy ðŸ˜…).

Since this project primarily serves as an exam submission, I implemented some parts of the code in a "hacky" and somewhat messy way, which results in a lack of performance optimization, maintainability and scalability ðŸ˜…. For these reasons, **I strongly don't recommend** using this entire repo as a foundation for a real-world website.


## Requriment

This project built which react, so you will need `node.js` installed globally on your machine.

## Installation and Setup
